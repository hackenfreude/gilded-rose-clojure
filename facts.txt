at the end of each day, sell-in and quality both decrease by 1
once sell-in passes (zero?), quality degrades 2x (by 2 rather than 1)
quality is never negative
Aged Brie quality goes up rather than down
Sulfuras never has to be sold (what does this mean for sell-in?) and quality never decreases (stays 80)
Backstage passes increase in quality: 10 >= days > 5 ... quality increases by 2; 5 >= days > 0.. increases by 3
nothing has a quality above 50


TEST CASES:
1. quality is never negative
2. sell-in decreases each day (except sulfuras)
3. quality decreases each day, but by complicated ways
	3a. aged brie is different.. goes up
	3b. sulfuras stays the same
	3c. backstage passes do weird things
4. quality never above 50
